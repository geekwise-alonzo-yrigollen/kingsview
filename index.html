                    <p id="kings">Kings View is the leader in serving the underserved in behavioral health and has been since 1951. With a strong tradition of commitment, our focus is on serving rural communities where other health resources are often limited. Treating people with care and compassion is the cornerstone of our philosophy – valuing each person’s worth, dignity and wholeness in body, mind and spirit. This is our principal core value that has echoed throughout the organization and into our many patient-focused programs. At Kings View we are dedicated to continuing to demonstrate our unparalleled commitment to wellness and recovery within each community we serve.</p>
